# XR Lab – Quest 3 Quick Guide (Codex Instructions)

Scope:
- This project is a single-file offline slideshow for Meta Quest 3 basics.

Hard rules:
- Quest 3 only.
- Minimal, no fluff. No extra commentary or “fun” language.
- 3–6 bullets per slide max.
- Large text, high contrast, no scrolling on common displays.
- No external dependencies (no CDNs, no frameworks).
- Keep navigation simple: click/tap advances, ←/→, optional fullscreen (F).

Editing rules:
- Prefer small, incremental changes.
- Don’t add new features unless explicitly requested.
- If you add images: use local files under ./img/ only.

Definition of done:
- Slideshow runs offline, loads instantly, and is readable from across a room.
